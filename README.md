## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
>Version control helps  developers to track changes in there code -This enables easy collaboration with other developers by showing when and who made changes  to the code
>Why is GitHub popular 
-It used to host repositories online instead of your local machine where it ensures the safety of your project incase something happens to your local machine and also makes it easier to collaborate with other developers 
-Offers a selection of tools such as pull requests for which is used to review and merge code and issue  tracking which is also built in and is used to report bugs,proposes enhancements and manage tasks by team members
>How does version control maintain project integrity 
-History tracking rvery change is saved which enables developers to know who changed what and when
-Rollback capability you can easily go back to a previous version of your project if a mistake occurs 
-Collaboration safety multiple developers can easily contribute to project from different parts of the world 

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
How to create a GitHub repository 
>Log into your GitHub account 
>Find the section written new repository then click it to create a new repository 
>Name your repository
>Choose the visibility (public or private)
Optionally add a dd a README file and choose a .gitnore file licence 
>Click create repository 

What are some important decisions you need to make when creating a repository 
>Visibility this determines who can see you repo
if you choose public this will enable people to collaborate on your project while private will keep your project confidential 
>Additional files such as a README file license a .gitnore will give out guidelines to users and contributors 



## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
